ABSTRACT = {Grapes are one of the world’s most widely distributed crops and are cultivated in more than 100 countries in the global scheme. Due to climate change and improper vine growth variable selection, production has significantly decreased across countries. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to develop a land suitability analysis method using a fuzzy expert system at a regional scale. The fuzzy membership function was used in the ArcGIS® environment to perform the spatial analysis, and the overlay function was used to generate the final suitability map for Afghanistan considering policy planning. The results indicated that 23% (15,760,144 ha) of the areas were potential and located in the highly suitable region for grape production; however, 11% (7,370,025 ha) of the regions were not suitable for vineyards throughout the country of Afghanistan. In the present study, it was observed that most of the vineyards were in highly suitable areas (90%, 80,466 ha), while 0.01% (5 ha) of the vineyards were in less suitable areas. The present analysis demonstrated that the significant extension of grape vines can be possible in highly suitable areas. The results of this research can support decision-makers, farm managers and land developers to find more prospective acreage for expanding vineyards in Afghanistan.},

ABSTRACT = {Mass movements processes (i.e., landslides and snow avalanches) play an important role in landscape evolution and largely affect high mountain environments worldwide and in Italy. The increase in temperatures, the irregularity of intense weather events, and several heavy snowfall events increased mass movements’ occurrence, especially in mountain regions with a high impact on settlements, infrastructures, and well-developed tourist facilities. In detail, the Prati di Tivo area, located on the northern slope of the Gran Sasso Massif (Central Italy), has been widely affected by mass movement phenomena. Following some recent damaging snow avalanches, a risk mitigation protocol has been activated to develop mitigation activities and land use policies. The main goal was to perform a multidisciplinary analysis of detailed climatic and geomorphological analysis, integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) processing, to advance snow avalanche hazard assessment methodologies in mass movement-prone areas. Furthermore, this work could represent an operative tool for any geomorphological hazard studies in high mountainous environments, readily available to interested stakeholders. It could also provide a scientific basis for implementing sustainable territorial planning, emergency management, and loss-reduction measures.},

ABSTRACT = {The dramatic growth of the world’s population is increasing the pressure on natural resources, particularly on soil systems. At the same time, inappropriate agricultural practices are causing widespread soil degradation. Improved management of soil resources and identification of the potential agricultural capability of soils is therefore needed to prevent further land degradation, particularly in dryland areas such as Egypt. Here, we present a case study in the El-Fayoum depression (Northern Egypt) to model and map soil suitability for 12 typical Mediterranean crops. Two management scenarios were analyzed: the current situation (CS) and an optimal scenario (OS) of soil variables. The Almagra model was applied to estimate soil suitability under CS and OS. Management options based on the CS assessment were proposed to reduce some limiting factors: a fixed value of 2 dSm−1 for soil salinity and 5% for sodium saturation; these defined the OS. Under optimal management, the OS scenario showed potential, where a notable increase of the area covered by a high suitability class (around 80%) for annual and semi-annual crops was observed. There was also a marked increase (about 70% for CS and 50% for OS) for perennial crops shifting from the marginal to moderate soil suitability class. The results reveal the importance of proper management to massively alter soil suitability into better states in order to achieve sustainable land use in this fertile agro-ecosystem.},
